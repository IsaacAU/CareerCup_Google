>## 1. You are given a String of number characters (S), like the following for example: 
>"132493820173849029382910382" 
>Now, let's assume we tie letters to numbers in order such that: 
>A = "0" 
>B = "1" 
>C = "2" 
>... 
>M = "12" 
>N = "13" 
>... 
>Y = "24" 
>Z = "25" 
>Write an algorithm to determine how many strings of letters we can make with S, by converting from numbers to letters.
