You are given a String of number characters (S), like the following for example: 
"132493820173849029382910382" 
Now, let's assume we tie letters to numbers in order such that: 
A = "0" 
B = "1" 
C = "2" 
... 
M = "12" 
N = "13" 
... 
Y = "24" 
Z = "25" 
Write an algorithm to determine how many strings of letters we can make with S, by converting from numbers to letters.
